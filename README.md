FIRE DETECTION USING OPENCV AND G-STREAMER

This project is based on the practical application of open vision, neural networks, and
applications of machine learning. The main modules which we are going to use in this project
are open-CV and Gstreamer.RTPS protocols will be used for data transferring and the
metafiles will be transferred. Audiovisual cameras will be used for fire and smoke detection
in fire-prone areas and a signal will be transferred to the server and an automated alarm will
be generated.
